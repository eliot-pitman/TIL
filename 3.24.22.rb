#connecting table
#best practice is to create a new table with combined names -- catagory_product. creates new data which combines two attributes that both have_many of the other.
#e.g. shoes have a lot of catagories, catagories have a lot of shoes. simplify this by creating a new table that connectes each shoe with a specific catagory
